# H1B Visa Predictor Project

Thanks for taking the time to checkout some of my work. 

This project is a page that predicts if you will get the H1B visa approved based on almost 5,000 cases from 2013 to 2017. I know that Trump just suspended them, but it's still fun to see what would happen once everything gets back to normal.

This is what I did (more details on the [page](http://h1b-visa.herokuapp.com/)): After cleaning the dataset, I used a Gradient Boosting model, then selected the top six features using permutation feature importance, and finally, I explained the predictions using Shap values.
